# bash-it lambda

## what

The AWS runtime doesn't support bash. However, bash is one of my favorite languages,
and is portable acrosss \*nix systems. Surely there is a way to break out of the
container AWS Lambda confines you to?

Nominally, uses a python runtime. But that's just an overhead wrapper before we
drop down into the good stuff.
